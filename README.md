# Canvas Quiz Notes
## Overview
This script uses JavaScript to scrape all necessary questions and their corresponding answers. At the moment it prints this info formatted into the browser console.
## Motivation
For one of my classes the professor has said that the tests will be based off the online quizzes on Canvas. She said to study from these quizzes and take notes on them. After taking the quiz, if the correct answer was no submitted then the correct answer will be shown. Previously I copied and pasted the questions/answers but have now decided to make my life easier as there are 10 quizzes during the whole semester. Using JavaScript I will be able to get all the necessary info I need that can later be formatted for my study guide.
## Usage
Get to the console on your preferred broswer and login to Canvas. Complete the quiz and go to its review page that shows the correct answers. Copy the code from script.js and paste it into the browser console. Hit Enter and the console output should be all necessary information.
